# Space Cadets Timer
**Space Cadets Timer** is a specialized companion utility for the board game [*Space Cadets*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123096/space-cadets) by [**Stronghold Games**](https://strongholdgames.com/).

In the heat of the mission, players have strictly limited time to complete their station tasks. This app replaces the standard sand timer with a highly visible, customizable digital countdown that ensures every second of chaos is accounted for.
